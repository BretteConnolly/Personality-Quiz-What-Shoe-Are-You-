# Personality-Quiz-What-Shoe-Are-You-
What this program does:
Personality quizzes are everywhere -- but is there any truth to them? This program compares the result of a quiz matching a shoe type to the user's 
personality to the user's stated shoe preference. It determines whether the final result is accurate, as well as the questions for which the user's
answer matched their true preference. 

What this program entails:
-- Five possible results with 1-2 shoe types each
-- Seven multiple choice questions in which each letter answer corresponds to a result
-- The result determined by the letter that the user selected the most
-- The user's true shoe preference, asked after the seven questions. This question is asked at the end so that the user won't fall into a pattern of 
selecting the same letter as their true preference throughout the quiz.
-- The result, whether or not it matched the true preference, and which questions did and did not match the true preference

Future applications:
-- A database storing multiple users' results, so as to have more data on the efficacy of the quiz overall and the individual questions
-- More questions
-- Shoe images
-- Product recommendations for the user to buy, linked to ecommerce sites
